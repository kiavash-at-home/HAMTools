History of YAGIMAX Versions:
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
1.00 (2/15/90) Started designing new and faster math code to replace YAGINEC.
1.01 (2/27/90) First version with a few bugs. Only released to two people.
1.02 (3/3/90) This version corrected a few minor bugs and added a bypass 
     feature for VSWR frequencies.
1.03 (3/8/90) This is basically the same as 1.02 but with the VGA capability 
     added.
1.04 (3/20/90) made a couple of minor corrections and added a moving cursor
     for the VSWR frequency plot. Only a few disks released of this version.
1.05 (3/22/90) This version allows graphically viewing the physical antenna
     and added EGA to the VGA capability.
1.06 (3/28/90) This version added Gain, F/B/ and VSWR linear plots which
     provides a more conventional type of display. 
1.07 (3/31/90) This version corrected a math error which I found after
     being prompted by correspondence from W5PAQ. Results from this 
     version of YAGIMAX will differ slightly from previous versions by 
     about 0.3 percent. Sorry about that! 
2.01 (4/2/90) This new generation has the added feature of polar
     plotting of the E-plane antenna pattern. In EGA and VGA all
     screen text is in the 43 line mode.
2.02 (4/5/90) Adds H-plane plotting capability in both free space and
     above perfect ground.
2.03 (4/9/90) At suggestion of W5PAQ: When calculating Gain, F/B, and
     impedance, a hard copy is now allowed when shortcutting the process
     by using <ESC>. No graph of these data is allowed unless the
     routine is allowed to proceed the full page, however. 
2.04 (4/15/90) This version adds linear pattern plotting per request of 
     K2GAL and others. (only 2 copies released)  
2.05 (4/17/90) At the request of K2GAL the capability for plotting free
     space stacked antennas has been added. This version also has a
     slightly modified algorithm to allow YAGINEC and YAGIMAX to track
     more closely. Runs made with this version will have slightly
     different results from older versions.
2.06 (4/21/90) (1)This version corrects a small error in the maximizing
     routine which occurs when the dimension must be lengthened rather
     than shortened. This was a result of transporting the routine from
     YAGINEC 7.01 and omitting one step. (2) The angle steps are doubled 
     when the antenna has over 20 elements or is over 5 W/L above ground.
     The math code was made "tighter" in this version which speeds up the
     calculations, particularly when the antenna is stacked, or over
     ground. (only 2 released)
2.07 (4/25/90) After more discussions with K2GAL, the stacking algorythm
     was modified to multiply the pattern of a single Yagi by the
     array factor of isotropic point sources. The results obtained by 
     this are different that those of 2.05/2.06 which multiplied the 
     current contributions (both real and imaginary) by the array factor
     and then summed them to derive gain. Which is more accurate in the 
     real world? Take your pick! (only sent to K2GAL)
2.08 (5/2/90) Version 2.07 still not correct per discussions with K2GAL.
     Found problem with free space stacking algorithm and I think that
     this version may be the correct one. Also this version provides
     E-plane stacking in free space. 
2.09 (5/14/90) HOORAY!! Finally corrected the stacking algorithm which 
     was plagueing previous versions thanks to Hank Kasper, K2GAL, who
     took the time and effort to manually grind out the numbers and 
     send them to me. I think we finally have it correct. Thanks Hank.
     The EGA/VGA modes are now in the 80 by 43/50 text mode which may
     help some of the EGA/VGA users. The number of Yagi elements has 
     been extended to 38/45 for EGA/VGA. A small mod was also made to 
     default the value of the frequency increment step per request 
     of W5PAQ. 
2.10 (5/23/90) This version is the same as 2.09 except for the scale
     change feature when using linear plotting.(K2GAL)
2.11 (5/31/90) Lawson's radius scaling algorithm is incorporated to
     provide a more accurate means of changing frequencies for a 
     design. (W5PAQ) In addition, Pressing <Z> when using linear
     plotting toggles a -13 dB line.(K2GAL)
2.12 (6/2/90) Corrected a problem which only can occur when using
     the MAXIMIZING feature. When the VSWR at one of the adjacent 
     frequencies goes above 100:1, an illegal function call may occur.
     (The program attempts to take square root of a negative number). 
     I inadvertently discovered this when optimizing a design where 
     the first and second directors actually came to a crossover 
     spacing! Not usually encountered in practice.
2.13 (6/6/90) Adds dimensions to VIEW feature. (10 el or less)   
2.14 (7/5/90) Corrects (hopefully) a problem some EGA users have 
     encountered is graphics displays. This version is same as
     2.13 except for this EGA mod.
2.15 (7/26/90) This version is virtually identical to 2.14 except
     the user can select whether YAGIMAX is normalized more closely
     to the results obtained with NEC-2 code, or closer to MININEC
     code as was done with previous versions from  2.05 on. (K2GAL)
     A glitch when saving to a directory where no .INP files exist is
     corrected.(W5PAQ)     
2.16 (8/18/90) This version has been normalized to match NEC2 results
     and compensate for large diameter elements. (K2GAL & LU8EBH)
2.17 (9/8/90) Further refined NEC2 normalizing to a second order
     correction. It now tracks within +/- 0.5% of NEC2.(K2GAL)
2.18 (10/8/90) Fixed minor problem when plotting a design which 
     exhibits a split front lobe.(K2GAL)	
2.19 (11/15/90) Identical to 2.18 except provides the option of 
     keeping the same element spacing when performing a design 
     scale to a new frequency.
2.20 (11/22/90) The center of gravity arrow in the VIEW plot now
     provides the dimension from the reflector end of the boom.
     When entering dimensions by keyboard in NEW DESIGN, the 
     Escape <ESC> key reverts back to the beginning menu as long 
     as any dimensions (except reflector position) remain zero. 
     When entering POLAR plot, "E-Plane" and "1" antenna are 
     defaulted by hitting <ENTER>.
2.21 (1/1/91) This version allows EGA/VGA COLOR users to select 
     graphics in black and white, or color, from within the program. 
     This provides the user the ability to view the plot in color 
     while allowing him/her the option to make a hard copy from 
     b & w without exiting the program and rebooting. (TNX N7OCN)
2.22 (2/10/91) This version is virtually the same as 2.21 except
     to prompt the user after a maximize run to see if he wishes to
     replace the old dimension with the new maximized dimension.
     Versions up to 2.22 were all compiled using Microsoft 
     QuickBASIC 4.5. Version 2.22 was compiled using Microsoft
     Basic Professional Development System 7.0 which results in
     a more compact program which runs approximately 60% faster 
     than the previous versions.
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴횼ew Version컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
3.01 (3/1/91) This version is completely changed in style and
     format. It features a topline menu which is <ALT> key and
     mouse driven. Help screens are available and "hot" function
     keys are available for various functions. The algorithms
     and mathematical calculations remain the same as versions
     2.17 to 2.22. YAGIMAX is now one year old and was in need
     of a facelift.
3.02 (4/30/91) Added monitor self determination feature to 
     eliminate the need to query the user as to what type of
     monitor was is use. (CGA/EGA/VGA)
3.03 (5/17/91) Fixed an editing bug incurred upon hitting <ENTER> 
     too many times. Created an keyboard subroutine to save 
     program space. No mouse cursor after printing results is 
     fixed. 
3.04 (5/21/91) When performing Design Scale, or editing any 
     dimension, the program now inhibits previous results such
     as print, Smith charts, and Display Results until another 
     Gain, F/B, and Impedance run is performed with the new
     dimensions. 
3.05 (6/5/91) Corrected a scrolling off the screen problem when
     maximizing exceeds 20 steps. Tightened up the maximization
     tolerance for less granuality. Fixed a bug which shows up 
     occasionally when too many steps are made during maximizing. 
     Fixed maximizing problem with a 2 element design as a 
     director/driven element.
3.06 (7/2/91) As per correspondence with LU8EBH the maximizing
     feature remains in "maximize" and utilizes the same frequencies
     unless recycled through the top line menu. Also the VSWR center
     frequency can be changed without repeating the entire set of
     frequencies. Linear plots of the H-plane over perfect
     ground are now on the right side of the plot with positive
     elevation angles!
3.07 (7/19/91) Provides double clicking of mouse for file selection.
     Flicker reduction routine added when switching between text
     and graphics modes.
3.08 (7/30/91) Adds a 3 dimensional plotting capability to the
     graphics options for EGA/VGA users. Speeded up the graphics 
     algorithm somewhat. (Only given to W9GCW)
3.09 (8/1/91) Fixed bug when maximizing after making a plot. Corrected 
     the <ESC> key when maximizing. Changed order of 3-D plotting for 
     clarity. Fixed a bug discovered when first plotting a H-plane
     over perfect ground then next running Gain, F/B, and VSWR vs.
     frequency which produced negative gain and zero F/B. Probably has
     been there from the first! The left/right keys will toggle the
     menu boxes similiar to the tab key. The <ALT> key will exit the
     dimensions screen in addition to the <ESC> key. 
3.10 (8/7/91) Added "Save Results" to Options menu to allow the Gain,
     F/B, and Impedance results to be saved to disk file for future 
     reference. 
3.11 (9/26/91) The ability to add or subtract to the number of elements 
     with an existing design has been added per my visit with Georges, 
     F1BBI, in Paris in early September.
